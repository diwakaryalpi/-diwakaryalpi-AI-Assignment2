### How to compile and execute
I have used Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda Navigator to execute the program. Implemented the genetic algorithm to use semi-transparent rectangles to mimic Monalisa's image. Each rectangle is represented by 4 points in 2D space, (x0, y0), (x0, y1), (x1, y0), (x1, y1) and a color of (r, g, b). 

The program is written using Python3 and the command to execute the code is as follows:
    
    %run genetic.py
    
The input is already provided in the program. To change the input file, the imageTest attribute in the file genetic.py has to be updated with the relevant file names.
